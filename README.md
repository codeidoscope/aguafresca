This is an 8th Light Apprenticeship project that will be linked to a Tic Tac Toe project in the future. Yay...

## Setup

#### Requirements
- Java 10 (I used Homebrew to install it)

(I'm intending to have this run on Mac, so if you're on Linux or Windows, please report back as to how it works!)

#### Running it

You can't do that yet. I haven't written any code.

#### Using it

You obviously can't do that either. I still haven't written any code.
